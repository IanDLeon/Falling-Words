# Falling-Words

# Start up screen: Background of ASCII falling from the top of the page with instructions on how to play, and the play button.

# Once you are in game I would like to have a 3 sec timer to get the user ready.

# There would be different levels of the words falling at different speeds from the top of the page. 

# When the words fall the user will have to type them out, once they are typed out they should disappear from the screen. 

# Add a health bar, every time the words hit the bottom player loses 10% of health.
